# mytinerary_backend

## Mytinerary API
### Made by Sean Byrne.
### GitHub: https://github.com/sbyrne22/mytinerary_app_api
### Overview
  The perfect place to add and share you itineraries with your party or event goers.
### Deployment
  This site is currently deployed on heroku
### Approach
  I started by setting up the backend with the necessary models I needed to start. I then checked them in 'Postman' to make sure they all worked how I wanted.
### Technical Difficulties
  I had issues figuring out what models I needed and how I wanted them connected.
### Future Implementations
  In the future, I would like to make a more secure authorization process, as well as forgot password functionality.
### Tech Used
  - PostgreSQL, Ruby/Rails
  - Gems:ruby, rails, pg, puma, bcrypt, jwt, dotenv-rails, bootsnap, rack-cors, byebug,
  - Text Editor: Atom
  - Postman for testing.
#### Acknowledgments
  Thank you to for all the supports from my classmates while attending General Assembly.
